# Quick-Sort<br>
Quick Sort witten by c<br>
I have used this algorithm and it works well with small input arrays, and actually best algorithm for the programming people. 
I like quick sort, due it is implementation in this code. As a teacher, this code is easy, simple, and fast. If you want to use this code, please provide accredition to the coders.
